# megtools
Toolbox for import and analysis of 4D Neuroimaging MEG data. Import based on Eugene Kronberg's pdf4D object code, provided in repository. Code likely has limitations specific to Colorado MEG install or similar (248 channel 1st order gradiometer configuration). Import/export functionality is provided with EEGLAB, Fieldtrip and SPM8 although it is likely that new developments in those toolboxes have already or will soon break those functions. I'm no longer actively developing new functionality, but will work on bug fixes if submitted. Code has been tested on Matlab R2012b through R2016b.
