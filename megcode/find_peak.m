function [amp lat ind] = find_peak(MEG,range)
%PURPOSE:   code to find peaks
%NOTE:      offset computed from entire prestim baseline and subtracted from
%           data.
%TO DO:     offset correction for continuous data
%INPUT:     MEG structure - see get4D.m
%           range = [begin end] in ms to search
%OUTPUT:    amp   = amplitude at peak
%           lat   = latency at peak
%           ind   = time index in sample units for peak
